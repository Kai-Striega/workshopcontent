There are a lot of different editors and it largely boils down to personal preference. Most Python programmers use complex but extremely powerful IDEs \(Integrated Development Environments\), such as PyCharm. As a beginner, however, that's probably less suitable; our recommendation is equally powerful, but a lot simpler.

Our suggestion is below, but feel free to ask your coach what their preferences are – it'll be easier to get help from them.

## VS Code

VS Code is a very popular and free to use editor. It's available for Windows, OS X and Linux.

## Why are we installing a code editor?

You might be wondering why we are installing this special code editor software, rather than using something like Word or Notepad.

The first reason is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text \(with fonts and formatting\), using custom formats like [RTF \(Rich Text Format\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your favorite tools. :\)

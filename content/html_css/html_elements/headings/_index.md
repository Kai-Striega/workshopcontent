# Headings

Once we've got our content, we also need to split it up under different headings. There are different levels of heading elements that we can use for this.

The top level of headings is the `h1` element, and typically there is only one of these on each page. The `h1` level heading should be used to define the page title, the main name for the page.

```html
<h1>Page Title</h1>
```

To break up the page into further sections, we can use the rest of the heading elements, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5` and `h6` (although you wouldn't normally use `h5` and `h6`).

```html
<h1>Page Title</h1>

<h2>Section Heading</h2>

<h3>Sub Section Heading</h3>
```

# Paragraphs

One of the most common HTML elements is the paragraph element, which has the tag name of `p`

```html
<p>You can write a paragraph of text here, inside the paragraph tag.</p>
<p>If you have a second paragraph, you can use another paragraph element to write it underneath the first paragraph.</p>
```

Try it out yourself in the Codepen below (remember if you want to keep what you write, make sure you click **Edit on Codepen** to save it in your account).

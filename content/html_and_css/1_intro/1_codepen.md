Throughout this course, weâ€™ll be writing code in a Codepen, which is an online code editing tool. This allows us to write HTML and CSS without needing to install anything on your computer as we'll do it all in a web browser.

Before you start writing any code, [head over to CodePen](https://codepen.io) and sign up for a free account.

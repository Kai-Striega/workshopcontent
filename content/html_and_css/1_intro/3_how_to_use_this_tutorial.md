Before we get too ahead of ourselves, here are a couple quick instructions for how to use this tutorial.

A code block like this:

```html
<h1>Myrtle the Turtle</h1>
```

means you need to add brand new code to your editor.

A code block like this:

```diff
-<h1>Myrtle the Turtle</h1>
+<h1>Flippy the Turtle</h1>
```

Means that you need to update your existing code.

The first line has a `-` at the start of it, meaning this line needs to be removed.

The seond line has a `+` at the start of it, meaning this line needs to be added.

Look out for whether a code block says `html` or `diff` at the top. An `html` block is new code, a `diff` block is modifying existing code.

Now that you have a CodePen account, let's create our first "pen"!

We've created a template for you to get started with.
Open the template by [clicking this link](https://codepen.io/shecodesaus/pen/NWwjQrr?editors=1000).

Once you've opened the pen, click the `fork` button on the bottom left of the page.

This will make a copy of the pen under your account.
This means that you can edit it as much as you like and keep your changes.

## Let's write some code!

Now that we are all set up, let's write some code.

Add the following to the HTML editor:

```html
<h1>Myrtle the Turtle</h1>
```

The result should look like the below example:

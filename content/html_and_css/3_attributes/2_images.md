All of the elements we have used so far have had an opening and a closing tag.

There are a a few elements that are **self closing**.
For these tags, instead of having content between an open and close tag, they have content provided as an **attribute**.

![Annotated self closing HTML Element.](../../images/self_closing_element.png)

The image element is a self closing element, and has the tagname `img`.

We can use the following html to add an image to a webpage:

```html
<img src="link/to/image" />
```

The `src` attribute means **source** and it expects a URL to an image.

The next challenge asks you to add images to your page.
Here are three image URLs to use for this challenge:

- [Turtle 1](../../images/turtle_1.jpg)
- [Turtle 2](../../images/turtle_2.jpg)
- [Turtle 3](../../images/turtle_3.jpg)

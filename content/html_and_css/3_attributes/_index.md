As we've learned, webpages are made up of **elements**.
We've looked at just a handful of elements so far.

So far our elements have consisted of a tag name and content.
But elements can also have what we call **attributes**. Attributes allow us to define more information about the element.
We do this by adding the `attribute` to the oppening tag and providing a `value` inside of quotes.

For example, the following is an `h1` element with an `id` attribute of value `title`:

![Annotated HTML Element with attribute.](../images/element_with_attribute.png)

Next we'll take a look at a couple of elements which require attributes..

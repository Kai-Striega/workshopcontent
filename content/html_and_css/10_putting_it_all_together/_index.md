Wow! We've learned A LOT!

Time for you to put it all together and get practicing!

Start working on what YOU want to create!

Pick a theme for a website and start building!

Here are our suggested steps for creating a new website:

1. Draw it. Get out a pen and paper and sketch up a plan.
2. Annotate it. Make a plan for the structure of the page, what is a header, p, div, etc..
3. Write the HTML
4. Write the CSS - starting with sizing and layout.
5. Iterate. As you go you'll realise your annotations weren't right, or maybe you want to go with a different colour scheme, etc. That's totally fine! It's part of the process!

Good luck!

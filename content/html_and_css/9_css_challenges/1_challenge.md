We've created most of the following page:

![](../../images/css_challenge_3.png)

The only problem is, our CSS got a bit jumbled...

The CSS has all the properties and selectors you need, but they aren't matched up.

Your job is to move the properties from the comment at the top of the file to the relevant selector.

You don't need to write any additional CSS or HTML to complete this challenge.

{{% /notice %}}

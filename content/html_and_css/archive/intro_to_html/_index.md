# What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**, and is the foundation and building blocks of not only the internet, but also other types of software and applications.

We can use HTML to bridge the gap between computers and people, a programming language that we can both read, used to define structure (and sometimes presentation) of your content. Markup languages (like HTML) are written in a way that makes sense for your computer to read and interpret, but we can also read and interpret the content (once we learn how).

Markup languages work similarly to how you would structure a report or document, and allow you to define different sections and types of content (eg. headings, images and lists).

In HTML, your content is made up of *elements*, with different elements being used to define different types of content, we'll look at how these work later.

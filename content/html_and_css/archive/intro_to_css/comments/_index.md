# Comments

As with HTML, we can add comments to our CSS, although the syntax, or tags that we use to denote a comment is a little different.

While in HTML, we use `<!--` and `-->` to wrap our comments, in CSS we use `/*` and `*/` instead.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

```css
/* This is a comment in CSS */
p {
	property: value;
	/* This is also comment in CSS */
}
```

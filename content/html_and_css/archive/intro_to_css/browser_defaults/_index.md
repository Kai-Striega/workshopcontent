# Browser Defaults

As you may have already noticed, our HTML content already has some styles on it. Our headings are bigger than our paragraphs, our `h1` elements are bigger than our `h3` elements, some of our headings are bold, our lists have bullets or numbers and there is spacing between each of the elements so that the content isn't really squished up.

By default, our browsers have default styles applied, which define the way a specific HTML element should look, and giving us a rough starting point.

Your content may look different to the examples, or it may look different from the person sitting next to you. This is ok, because these default styles will differ slightly depending on your web browser, and operating system. We'll also be overriding some of those styles, so if you really want to, you can make a `h1` look exactly like a `p`.

Quite often we want to leave a note in our code to explain what something does (especially if we are new to this).
We can do this by writing **comments**.

Comments are tags that appear in our code but not on the webpage.
This lets us write notes to ourselves about what some code means and what it does.


A comment looks like this:

```html
<h1>Myrtle the Turtle</h1>
<!-- This is a comment to myself -->
<h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
```

The above html looks like this when rendered:

{{% notice challenge %}}

Add comments to your code to explain what each line of code does.

{{% /notice %}}

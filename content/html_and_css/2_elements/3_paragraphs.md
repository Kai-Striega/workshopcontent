One of the most common HTML elements is the **paragraph** element, which has the tag name of `p`.

We use the paragraph element when we want to display a block of text.

For example:

```html
<h3>Size</h3>

<p>The size of a turtle varies depending on it's species, age, diet, gender, habitat and UV light.</p>
```

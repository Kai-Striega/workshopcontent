# Links

We also want to be able to add links to our website, these might be links to:

- Another page on our website
- Another website
- A document or file
- An email address
- A phone or fax number (yes, people still do that)

To do this, we use the `a` or **anchor** element, and will set the `href` (**H**ypertext **Ref**erence) attribute, to let the browser know where we want to link to, eg. to the She Codes website.

```html
<a href="https://shecodes.com.au">She Codes Australia</a>
```

Because the `a` element isn't self closing, we can also include the link content between the opening and closing tags, this is what will appear on the website.

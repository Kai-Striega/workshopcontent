# Why should you know HTML?

Because HTML is so widely used, and is the foundation of websites and applications, it's a great place to start when learning development, especially if you're interested in learning to build websites.

A good understanding of HTML is really useful when you go on to learn other programming languages, like CSS and JavaScript, and even a little bit of HTML knowledge can help you to supercharge your skills on the internet.

# CSS Selectors

So far when we've been writing our CSS we've just used the name of our HTML tag to reference a particular element, like `h2` or `img`.

But what if we don't want to make all the paragraphs the same colour, or put a border on all the images? There are other kinds of selectors that we can use, by adding "tags" to our HTML, we can reference individual elements, or groups of elements instead.

To do this, we need to learn about two more HTML attributes - `class` and `id`.

# Putting it all together

Now that we're able to target our HTML elements more specifically, let's go back to our Codepen from before, and try changing the styles by adding classes and IDs to your HTML.

If you can't find the Codepen, look in [Your Work](https://codepen.io/your-work/) in Codepen, and find the pen named **HTML Elements - All together now!**, unless you renamed yours.

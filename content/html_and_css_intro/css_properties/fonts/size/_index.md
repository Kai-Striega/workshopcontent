# Font Size

The first font property we're going to look at is `font-size`, which allows us to change the size of our text on the page.

```css
p {
	font-size: 20px;
}
```

In CSS, there are a range of different units to use (you can even use `cm` or `mm`), but most of the time you'll be dealing with pixels (`px`). If you want to find out about the other units you can use you can have a [look at the docs here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units), but for now we're going to set the size of our text using `px`.

Try changing the `font-size` of the content in the Codepen below. See what happens if you change the text to be `20px` or `10px` or `100px`.

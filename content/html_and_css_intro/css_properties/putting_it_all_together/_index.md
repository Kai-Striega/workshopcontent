# Putting it all together

Now that we've learnt a few of the basic CSS properties, we can start to put them together to style the HTML content we wrote before.

Find the CodePen we were working with earlier to write HTML content (if you can't find it, look in [Your Work](https://codepen.io/your-work/) in Codepen, and find the pen named **HTML Elements - All together now!**, unless you renamed yours).

If you need a recap, these are the properties that we've learnt so far:

- Colours
  - `color`
  - `background-color`
- Fonts
  - `font-size`
  - `font-weight`
  - `font-style`
  - `font-family`
- Size: `width` and `height`
- Spacing: `margin` and `padding`
- Borders: `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color` and `border`

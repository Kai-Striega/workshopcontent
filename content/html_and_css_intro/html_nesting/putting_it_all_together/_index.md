# Putting it all together

Now that we've learnt a few of the basic HTML elements, we can start to put them together to add content to our webpage. 

You can use your own content, or we've included a few example pages that you can copy the content from. We've also included a few image URLs that you can use to add images to your webpage.

If you need a recap, these are the elements that we've learnt so far:

- `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6` - Heading Elements
- `p` - Paragraph Elements
- `a` - Anchor/Link Element
- `img` - Image element
- `ul`, `ol`, `li` - List Elements

Because the internet would be boring without images, we can also add them to our websites using the `img` tag, which is a self-closing tag. We tell the browser what image to use, by setting the `src` (source) attribute, and giving it the URL of an image.

```html
<img src="https://quokkas.amyskapers.dev/img/quokka_(1).jpg" />
```

The image URL can be a local file (on our website) or a remote file (on someone else's website).

Try adding some more images to the Codepen below (you can use the below image URLs if you don't have any).

- [Cupcakes](images/cupcakes.jpg)
- [Dog](images/dog.jpg)
- [Quokka](images/quokka.jpg)
- [She Codes](images/she_codes.jpg)

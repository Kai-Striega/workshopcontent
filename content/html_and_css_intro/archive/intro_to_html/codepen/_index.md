# Codepen

Throughout this course, we'll be writing code in Codepen, which is an online code editing tool. This makes the processs of writing HTML much easier as you don't have to install anything on your computer, and can do it all in your web browser.

Most of the code you will be able to directly edit on the page, but this won't save if you refresh the page or move on to another step. If you'd like to keep the code you've written, you can click the **Edit on Codepen** button in the top right corner, and save it on your own Codepen account (you can create a free account at [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) {#link}), it's a really useful tool to play with and share the things you create!

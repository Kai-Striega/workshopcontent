# Static content

Stores all the static content: images, CSS, JavaScript, etc. When Hugo builds your site, all assets inside your static directory are copied over as-is. A good example of using the static folder is for [verifying site ownership on Google Search Console](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1142414?hl=en), where you want Hugo to copy over a complete HTML file without modifying its content.
